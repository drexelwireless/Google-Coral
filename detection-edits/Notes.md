# Notes

`opencv-detection-print.py`  
    An edited version of `detection.py` within the `examples-camera/opencv`
    example project provided by Google. This script prints the metadata of the
    objects detected in each frame rather than displaying it in a video.
    The [examples-camera/](https://github.com/google-coral/examples-camera)
    repository demonstrates the coral's object detection abilities with many
    camera streams, but OpenCV was found to perform the best during testing.
